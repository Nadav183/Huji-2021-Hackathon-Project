I need help on ways to deal with an animal passing. I've had her since I was 5 and have loved her every single day of her life. She was old and had to be put down. I held her as she took her last breath.

Over the last couple years my view on death has become a lot more grim. I've lost my cousin who was 2, he was run over by a garbage truck. Since then my childhood views on life and death have strayed from my once religious views. This is the first closet death that I have been around with my some what atheist point of view.

If anyone thinks of death as the end of everything, how do you deal with the death of loved ones?

I want to have friends but i cant talk frequently to people, i dont know if its because i think i am annoying them or is because after asking questions, normal conversation stuff like "how are you" "what you like to do" and etcetera, i dont know what to talk about so i just stop talking. What do i do?
